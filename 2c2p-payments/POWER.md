# 2C2P Payment Gateway Developer Guide

## Overview

This power provides comprehensive developer documentation for integrating with the **2C2P Payment Gateway (PGW)** — a full-service payment platform enabling online merchants to accept card, digital wallet, and alternative payment methods across Southeast Asia and globally.

**What 2C2P offers:**
- Accept payments via Visa, Mastercard, Amex, JCB, UnionPay, and more
- Digital wallets: Apple Pay, Google Pay, Alipay, WeChat Pay, Line Pay, GrabPay
- Alternative payments: Internet banking, over-the-counter, QR codes, direct debit
- Multiple integration methods: Hosted payment page, Direct API, Mobile SDK, Web SDK, plugins
- Regional coverage: Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Philippines, Hong Kong, and beyond

This documentation covers all integration methods, API references, payment flows, SDKs, and troubleshooting guidance.

## Agent Onboarding Behavior

When a user activates this power or asks about 2C2P / QuickPay / payment integration, follow this conversational flow:

### 1. Detect the User's Tech Stack
Inspect the workspace for project files (package.json, *.csproj, requirements.txt, composer.json, go.mod, project.godot, etc.). If the workspace is empty or ambiguous, ask the user what tech stack they're using.

### 2. Ask About Environment
Ask: "Which environment do you want to connect to — **Sandbox** (testing) or **Production** (live payments)?"
- Sandbox: Provide demo credentials from the steering file
- Production: Ask if they already have credentials. If not, direct them to https://2c2p.com/contact-us/

### 3. Guide Credential Storage
Based on their tech stack, guide secure credential placement:
- Node.js → `.env` file
- .NET → User Secrets / appsettings + Key Vault
- Python → `.env` or environment variables
- PHP → `.env` (Laravel) or config file
- Java → `application.properties` with env var references
- Unity/Godot → Server-side only, never in game client

### 4. Choose Integration Path
Based on what they want to do, load the appropriate steering file and guide implementation.

**If the user is unsure or wants the simplest option, recommend QuickPay Link first** — it's one API call to generate a payment link, no frontend UI needed, works from any backend language.

**For QuickPay Link integration**, load steering file: `quickpay.md`

### 5. Collect URLs for Redirect API Integration

**When the user chooses Redirect API (Hosted Payment Page) or you recommend it**, you **MUST** ask for the following URLs before proceeding with implementation:

1. **Frontend URL** — The URL where the customer will be redirected after payment completion (success/failure page).
2. **Backend URL** — The webhook/callback URL where 2C2P will send payment notifications (backend-to-backend).

Ask:
> "To configure the Redirect API integration, I need two URLs:
> 1. **Frontend URL** — Where should customers be redirected after payment? (e.g., `https://yoursite.com/payment/complete`)
> 2. **Backend URL** — Where should 2C2P send payment notifications? (e.g., `https://yoursite.com/api/payment/notify`)
>
> ⚠️ Both URLs must be **publicly accessible** — 2C2P's servers need to reach them over the internet."

**Do NOT proceed with code generation until both URLs are provided.** If the user provides a localhost or private network URL, warn them that it will not work in sandbox or production — 2C2P cannot reach private addresses. Suggest using a tunneling tool (e.g., ngrok) for local development if needed.

## Sandbox / Test Credentials

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: The credentials below are for **sandbox/testing only**. They do NOT work in production. For production credentials, merchants must contact 2C2P directly at https://2c2p.com/contact-us/.

### Payment Gateway API (JWT-based)

| Country | Currency | Merchant ID | Secret Key (HMAC SHA-256) |
|---------|----------|-------------|---------------------------|
| Singapore | SGD | `JT01` | `ECC4E54DBA738857B84A7EBC6B5DC7187B8DA68750E88AB53AAA41F548D6F2D9` |

### QuickPay API (HMAC-SHA1-based)

| Country | Currency | Merchant ID | Secret Key |
|---------|----------|-------------|------------|
| Singapore | SGD | `JT01` | `7jYcp4FxFdf0` |
| Myanmar | MMK | `JT02` | `YDRbw14OtHw3` |
| Indonesia | IDR | `JT03` | `uA7yXRa8PjVe` |
| Thailand | THB | `JT04` | `QnmrnH6QE23N` |
| Philippines | PHP | `JT05` | `B6LkVg5k07yg` |
| Hong Kong | HKD | `JT06` | `gVULqA2gT6Gi` |
| Malaysia | MYR | `JT07` | `XXqmLinNwsQO` |
| Vietnam | VND | `JT08` | `C8843nw92bx4` |

### When Users Ask for Test Credentials

Users can ask for sandbox/test credentials at any time. Provide them freely — they are public demo values. Always remind users:
- These are **sandbox-only** credentials for development and testing
- They will **NOT** work against production endpoints
- For production credentials, contact 2C2P sales/support

---

## Credential Handling Rules for Agent

When implementing code for users, follow these **strict rules** for handling credentials:

### Rule 1: Never Hardcode Secrets in Application Code

❌ **NEVER do this:**
```csharp
string secretKey = "7jYcp4FxFdf0"; // WRONG — hardcoded secret
```

❌ **NEVER do this either (fallback to hardcoded value):**
```csharp
string secretKey = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("SECRET_KEY") ?? "7jYcp4FxFdf0"; // WRONG — fallback exposes secret
```

✅ **DO THIS — fail if secret is missing:**
```csharp
string secretKey = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("PGW_SECRET_KEY") 
    ?? throw new InvalidOperationException("Required environment variable PGW_SECRET_KEY is not set.");
```

### Rule 2: Store Secrets in the Preferred Secret Storage for the Tech Stack

When generating implementation code, place credentials in the appropriate secret storage file — **never inline in source code**.

**Node.js / JavaScript / TypeScript → `.env` file:**
```env
PGW_MERCHANT_ID=<YOUR_MERCHANT_ID>
PGW_SECRET_KEY=<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>
QUICKPAY_MERCHANT_ID=<YOUR_MERCHANT_ID>
QUICKPAY_SECRET_KEY=<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>
```

**C# / .NET → `appsettings.json` (non-secret values) + User Secrets or environment variables (secrets):**
```json
// appsettings.json — safe for non-secret config
{
  "PGW": {
    "BaseUrl": "https://sandbox-pgw.2c2p.com",
    "MerchantId": "<YOUR_MERCHANT_ID>"
  }
}
```
```env
# Secret Key via environment variable or User Secrets — never in appsettings.json
PGW__SecretKey=<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>
```

**Python → `.env` file:**
```env
PGW_MERCHANT_ID=<YOUR_MERCHANT_ID>
PGW_SECRET_KEY=<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>
```

**PHP → `.env` file (Laravel) or environment variables:**
```env
PGW_MERCHANT_ID=<YOUR_MERCHANT_ID>
PGW_SECRET_KEY=<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>
```

**Java → `application.properties` with env var references:**
```properties
pgw.merchant-id=${PGW_MERCHANT_ID}
pgw.secret-key=${PGW_SECRET_KEY}
```

### Rule 3: Use Placeholder Values — Never Inject Real Keys into Code

When writing code for the user, always use placeholder format:
```
<YOUR_MERCHANT_ID>
<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>
```

Do NOT inject the sandbox test keys directly into the user's source code files, even for testing. Place them only in the appropriate secret storage file (`.env`, User Secrets, etc.).

### Rule 4: Ask Permission Before Reading User Secrets

Before reading any file that may contain secrets (`.env`, `appsettings.json` with secrets, User Secrets, `credentials.json`, etc.), **always ask the user for permission first**. Example:

> "I need to check your `.env` file to verify your credential configuration. May I read it?"

Never silently read secret-containing files.

### Rule 5: Providing Sandbox Values on Request

When a user explicitly asks for sandbox/test credentials (e.g., "What's the test secret key for Singapore?"), provide the value from the table above. But when writing implementation code, still follow Rules 1–3: place the value in the secret storage file with placeholder format, and read it from environment in the code.

**Example workflow when user asks to implement with sandbox credentials:**

1. Create/update `.env` (or equivalent) with the sandbox value:
   ```env
   PGW_SECRET_KEY=ECC4E54DBA738857B84A7EBC6B5DC7187B8DA68750E88AB53AAA41F548D6F2D9
   ```
2. In the source code, read from environment — no fallback:
   ```javascript
   const secretKey = process.env.PGW_SECRET_KEY;
   if (!secretKey) throw new Error('Required env var PGW_SECRET_KEY is not set');
   ```

## External Documentation (For Deeper Detail)

When steering files don't have enough detail, the agent can fetch source documents directly from 2C2P's developer portal. Each steering file includes a `## References` section with fetchable URLs (add `.md` to any 2C2P docs URL to get markdown format).

Example: `https://developer.2c2p.com/docs/api-quickpay-generate-link.md`

The agent should use `web_fetch` on these URLs when the steering content is insufficient for the user's question.

## Quick Start

### 1. Get Sandbox Credentials

Start with the sandbox environment to test without processing real payments:

- **Sandbox Base URL**: `https://sandbox-pgw.2c2p.com`
- **Demo Merchant ID**: `JT01` (or request from 2C2P team)
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens signed with HMAC SHA-256

### 2. Choose Your Integration Method

### 3. Make Your First API Call

Request a payment token to verify your setup:

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://sandbox-pgw.2c2p.com/payment/4.3/paymentToken' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "payload": "<your-signed-jwt-token>"
}'
```

The payload is a JWT-signed JSON containing:
```json
{
    "merchantID": "JT01",
    "invoiceNo": "1523953661",
    "description": "Test payment",
    "amount": 1000.00,
    "currencyCode": "SGD"
}
```

Successful response:
```json
{
    "webPaymentUrl": "https://sandbox-pgw-ui.2c2p.com/payment/4.3/#/token/...",
    "paymentToken": "kSAops9Zwhos8hSTSeLTUcCr...",
    "respCode": "0000",
    "respDesc": "Success"
}
```

### 4. Test with Test Cards

Use these test cards in sandbox:

| Card Scheme | Card Number        | CVV  | OTP    |
|-------------|-------------------|------|--------|
| Visa        | 4111111111111111  | 123  | 123456 |
| Mastercard  | 5555555555554444  | 123  | 123456 |
| Amex        | 378282246310005   | 1234 | —      |

## Integration Paths

### Hosted Payment Page (Redirect API)

**Flow:**
1. Request payment token from 2C2P
2. Redirect customer to hosted payment page
3. Customer completes payment on 2C2P page
4. Receive backend notification
5. Redirect customer back to your site

**Prerequisites — collect from user before implementation:**
- **Frontend URL** (redirect after payment) — must be publicly accessible
- **Backend URL** (webhook for payment notifications) — must be publicly accessible

**Use when:**
- You want the fastest integration
- You don't need custom payment UI
- You want 2C2P to handle PCI compliance

**Read steering file**: `redirect-integration.md`

### Direct API Integration

**Flow:**
1. Request payment token
2. Collect payment details on your page
3. Submit payment via Do Payment API
4. Handle 3DS redirects if needed
5. Receive payment result

**Use when:**
- You need full control over UI/UX
- You want custom checkout experience
- You're handling PCI compliance

**Read steering file**: `direct-integration.md`

### Mobile SDK

**Flow:**
1. Import SDK into iOS/Android app
2. Initialize SDK with merchant credentials
3. Present payment UI
4. Handle payment result in app

**Use when:**
- Building native mobile apps
- Want native payment experience
- Need mobile-optimized flows

**Read steering file**: `mobile-sdk.md`

## Payment Methods Supported

### Card Payments
- Visa, Mastercard, Amex, JCB, UnionPay, Diners, Discover
- 3D Secure authentication
- Card tokenization for recurring payments
- Installment payment plans (IPP)

### Digital Wallets
- Apple Pay, Google Pay
- Alipay, WeChat Pay
- Line Pay, GrabPay
- Regional wallets (GCash, TrueMoney, Touch 'n Go, etc.)

### Alternative Payments
- Internet banking / Mobile banking
- Over-the-counter payments
- QR code payments (EMV QR, Visa QR, Mastercard QR)
- Direct debit
- Self-service kiosks

## Authentication

All 2C2P API requests use **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** for security:

1. Build JSON payload with request parameters
2. Sign payload as JWT using HMAC SHA-256 with your Secret Key
3. Send signed JWT in `payload` field
4. Decode JWT response using same Secret Key

**Example JWT generation** (Node.js):
```javascript
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

// Secret key loaded from environment — never hardcode
const secretKey = process.env.PGW_SECRET_KEY;
if (!secretKey) throw new Error('Required env var PGW_SECRET_KEY is not set');

const payload = {
    merchantID: process.env.PGW_MERCHANT_ID,
    invoiceNo: "1523953661",
    amount: 1000.00,
    currencyCode: "SGD"
};

const token = jwt.sign(payload, secretKey, { algorithm: 'HS256' });
```

For complete JWT documentation, read steering file: `references.md` (Encryption and Signature section)

## Environment URLs

| Environment | Base URL |
|-------------|----------|
| Sandbox | `https://sandbox-pgw.2c2p.com` |
| Production | `https://pgw.2c2p.com` |

## Common Workflows

### Accept a Card Payment (Hosted Page)
1. Request payment token → `POST /payment/4.3/paymentToken`
2. Redirect to `webPaymentUrl` from response
3. Customer completes payment
4. Receive backend notification at your webhook URL
5. Show confirmation page

### Accept a Card Payment (Direct API)
1. Request payment token → `POST /payment/4.3/paymentToken`
2. Collect card details on your page
3. Submit payment → `POST /payment/4.3/doPayment`
4. Handle 3DS redirect if required
5. Check payment status → `POST /payment/4.3/paymentInquiry`

### Refund a Payment
1. Call Payment Inquiry to verify transaction
2. Submit refund request → Payment Maintenance API
3. Check refund status → Refund Status Inquiry API

### Tokenize a Card for Recurring Payments
1. Request payment token with `storeCard: true`
2. Complete initial payment
3. Store returned `cardToken`
4. Use `cardToken` for future payments without re-entering card

## Best Practices

### Security
- Never expose Secret Key in client-side code
- Never hardcode secrets in source code — always load from environment variables or secret managers
- Never use fallback values that contain real secrets (e.g., `?? "7jYcp4FxFdf0"` is forbidden)
- Always fail explicitly if a required secret is missing from the environment
- Store secrets in the appropriate location for the tech stack (`.env`, User Secrets, Key Vault, etc.)
- Always validate JWT signatures on responses
- Use HTTPS for all API calls
- Implement backend notification handling (webhooks)
- Store card tokens securely, never store raw card data

### Error Handling
- Check `respCode` in all API responses
- `0000` = Success, other codes indicate errors
- Implement retry logic for network failures
- Log all API requests and responses for debugging
- Handle 3DS redirects gracefully

### Testing
- Test all payment methods in sandbox before going live
- Use country-specific test cards for regional payment methods
- Test error scenarios (declined cards, expired cards, insufficient funds)
- Verify backend notifications are received correctly
- Test refund and void operations

### Performance
- Cache payment tokens appropriately (they expire)
- Implement timeout handling for API calls
- Use asynchronous processing for backend notifications
- Monitor API response times

### Compliance
- Follow PCI DSS requirements if handling card data
- Implement Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) for European cards
- Handle customer data per GDPR/local regulations
- Display clear payment terms and conditions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Payment Token Request Fails**
- Verify JWT signature is correct
- Check Merchant ID matches your credentials
- Ensure all required fields are present
- Validate amount format (decimal with 2 places)

**3DS Authentication Fails**
- Ensure you're handling redirects correctly
- Check browser allows popups/redirects
- Verify return URLs are accessible
- Test with 3DS test cards

**Backend Notification Not Received**
- Verify webhook URL is publicly accessible
- Check firewall allows 2C2P IP addresses
- Implement proper JWT validation on notifications
- Return HTTP 200 response to acknowledge receipt

**Payment Inquiry Returns Wrong Status**
- Allow time for payment processing (few seconds)
- Use correct invoice number
- Check you're querying correct environment (sandbox vs production)

### Response Codes

Common response codes:

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0000 | Success |
| 2001 | Invalid merchant ID |
| 2003 | Invalid currency code |
| 2004 | Invalid amount |
| 2014 | Duplicate invoice number |
| 4001 | Card declined |
| 4002 | Insufficient funds |
| 4003 | Invalid card number |

For complete response code reference, read steering file: `references.md`

## Going Live

When ready to move from sandbox to production:

1. **Get production credentials** — Contact 2C2P via https://2c2p.com/contact-us/ or your regional office (see Contact section below)
2. **Update base URL** to `https://pgw.2c2p.com`
3. **Replace credentials** with production Merchant ID and Secret Key
4. **Configure production webhook URL** for backend notifications
5. **Run live test transaction** with small amount
6. **Monitor first transactions** closely
